# Peak Demand Reduction Data Analysis
## Overview

This project analyzes Austin Energy’s peak demand reduction programs from 2007 to 2017.
The goal is to understand how different program categories — Residential, Commercial, and Demand — have contributed to reducing power demand over time.

Dataset

File: Peak_Demand_Reduction.csv

Each column from 2007 to 2017 represents the annual reduction (in MW) achieved by each program.
Columns include:

Program – name of the program

Program Type – Residential / Commercial / Demand

2007–2017 – yearly reduction values

Steps Performed

Read and cleaned the dataset using pandas.

Converted all yearly columns to numeric values.

Calculated:

Total reduction per program

Total reduction per program type (Residential, Commercial, Demand)

Yearly totals

Visualized the results using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Visualizations
